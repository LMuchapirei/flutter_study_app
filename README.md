# flutter_study_app

About
A follow along to build a study app and hopefully scale it after a solid foundation provided by the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSVnIphlGKI&ab_channel=dbestech)

<!-- rules_version = '2'; service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents { 
    match /questionPapers/{ppr}/questions/{q}{ 
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
      }
      
	match /leaderboard/{document=**} { 
  	allow read, write: if true;
	}
    match /questionPapers/{document=**} { 
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    match /users/{document=**} { 
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
} 
} -->

Finished waiting for part two but building some of the stuff demoed on my own in this part_sel branch
